### _**NFT Artwork Collector**_

As an NFT Artwork Collector, I'd like to know that there is a place where I can view and show off my collected artwork that is independent of whatever site or application I used to purchase my collected artworks.  Perhaps, I purchased the artwork from a small marketplace specializing in a very niche category of artwork, and perhaps this site doesn't provide the best embedding for sharing to social media, or perhaps it doesn't publicly expose a URL for non-logged-in users to view artworks, making sharing difficult.  In this circumstance, an independent explorer providing an objective view of NFT objects and activity on chain would be of use. Thus an NFT Artwork Collector might use TradeHands Explorer for the following reasons:

### _NFT Artist_

As an NFT Artist, I may be using specialized tools to create my NFTs and selling them on specialized or niche marketplaces with a focused audience that provide a particular "view" of the artworks.  To get a sense of how my NFTs look to the "rest of the world," or to get access to activity information and statistics perhaps not tracked by the marketplace I am selling on, an independent explorer providing an objective view of NFT objects and activity on chain could be useful. Thus an NFT Artist might use TradeHands Explorer for the following reasons,

### NFT Investor / Trader

As an NFT investor / trader, I may be using a different application than TradeHands Explorer for actual trading or market activity, but still benefit from an Explorer as it allows an objective, neutral view of objects and activity on chain.

### NFT Lottery User

The NFT Lottery system has a separate application that allows users to inspect lotteries, purchase tickets, and enjoy winnings. However, the lottery application is meant to be deployed by lottery hosts.  Thus, there may be a multiplicity of deployments, each showing lotteries relevant only to the deployment owners.  It may not provide a broad view of all lottery activity on chain, or perhaps a complete view of the individual lotteries in detail. An independent explorer allows users to have an objective view into the activities they are participating in. A lottery participant may use TradeHands Explorer for the following reasons,

### Concert Goer

The Concert Goer will have a separate application for purchasing and using NFT-powered concert tickets. However, such an application will likely have a streamlined, simplified user interface that obscures the details of the underlying NFT objects and blockchain activity. More technically-oriented users may gain comfort and confidence in the event tickets and their relevant apps usage by inspecting the objects on chain using an objective, independent explorer. An explorer can allow users to have a broader view of NFT-powered event ticket activity, perhaps revealing events of interest to them that are not highlighted in the ticket app they are using. Thus a Concert Goer might use TradeHands Explorer for the following reasons:

|   1.2   |      to verify the ticket authenticity      |             the Ticket issuer and event information can be viewed.            |
|   1.3   |        to see all the issuer details        | so that the website, information, details about  other events can be checked. |
|   1.4   | to see the tickets that have Souvenir value |               I can save the ticket/sell for a profitable price.              |

### Event Manager

The Event Manager may be using expensive licensed event-management software that provides a full-featured but controlled view of the NFT-powered events they are managing.  For verification and validation, an Event Manager may benefit from an independent explorer that provides an objective view of the objects and activity occurring on chain, including their own event ticket NFTs. Thus, the Event Manager might use TradeHands Explore for the following reasons:
