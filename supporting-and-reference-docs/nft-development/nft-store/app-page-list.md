# App Page List

## 1. Purpose

This is a living document which enumerates the app pages that need to be designed. Pages in this list may be added, removed, or changed depending on business needs and technical or design constraints discovered later in development.

## 2. Document Conventions

The following terms are used to describe specific users of the application:

* Unauthenticated (not logged in) users are known as `visitors`.
* Authenticated (logged in) users are known as `peers`.

The following terms are used to describe levels of user entitlement within the application:

* A `browser` is view only (except for account creation and logging in) and used for visitors.
* An `enjoyer` can interact with the market, including buying and optionally re-selling NFTs, but can’t make new NFTs.
* A `tenant` can create NFTs and sell them in addition to what the enjoyer can do.
* A `client` is an administrator level user with all entitlements.

The term `object(s)` refers to one of several concepts within the app: Peer Profiles, Galleries, Collections, NFTs, and Transactions.
